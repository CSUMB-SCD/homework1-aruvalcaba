README File

What was this project about? 

The project was about getting used to and learning how to work with the tools we will be using in the class including github, cloud9, and heroku. We had to create a simple html file
and edit it in someway. After that we need to create a public repositiory on github under the our CSUMB group. After that we needed to push the changes that we made to our html file
into the same repository. Then we needed to publish our app using Heroku.
What was the learning objectives

What are known problems, if any, with this assignment?

I had some problems using git initially, mainly when I reached the commit and had to enter my username and password because it was not letting me commit.
Heroku was new to me so I also had sme trouble getting my html file to publish
My repository was initialized with a readme on github which was conflicts which caused me some trouble because I did not know why my push was fatal.

How would you improve it if you had more time?

I would have most like done commits over time instead of one large commit and add better commit/add messages in order to make my repository make sense.
